### Precision Temperature Control Unit

### Group Members

* Nathan Lutterman  
* Kimball Davis  
* Jason Houlihan  



### What is it?

Our group is designing and building a temperature control unit.  In a nutshell, the device reads some ambient temperature from a temperature sensor.  If the temperature being read is outside of some bound, above or blow, the device activates and utilizes a fan or a lamp (as a heater) respectively.

It's intended to be a small, portable temperature control unit.  The user interface consists of several 7-segment digital displays which are used as feedback for the user while inputting values for thresholds, as well as displaying the temperature being read.

### What's in it?

The device mostly charge is an AT89S52 8-bit microcontroller.  It'll be driving the 7-segment displays, reading the data from the temperature sensor, and triggering the relays for the fan and lamp.

### Licenses
SDCC suite is a collection of several components derived from different sources with different licenses.  

All project shared libraries used and provided by sdcc are under the GPL with the following exception:

>   As a special exception, if you link this library with other files,
>   some of which are compiled with SDCC, to produce an executable,
>   this library does not by itself cause the resulting executable to
>   be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does
>   not however invalidate any other reasons why the executable file
>   might be covered by the GNU General Public License.



The following is from the sdcc manual (found [here](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/doc/sdccman.pdf)):

> – sdcc compiler:
> sdcc compiler is licensed under the GPLv2.
> The code or object files generated by SDCC suite are not licensed, so they can be used in FLOSS or
> proprietary (closed source) applications.
> 
> – dcpp preprocessor:
> derived from GCC cpp preprocessor http://gcc.gnu.org/; GPLv3 license
> 
> – sdas assemblers and sdld linker:
> derived from ASXXXX http://shop-pdp.kent.edu/ashtml/asxxxx.htm;

> 
> – SDCC run-time libraries:
> The great majority of SDCC run-time libraries are licensed under the GPLv2+LE which allows linking
> of SDCC run-time libraries with proprietary (closed source) applications.
> Exception are pic device libraries and header files which are derived from Microchip header (.inc) and
> linker script (.lkr) files. Microchip requires that "The header files should state that they are only to
> be used with authentic Microchip devices" which makes them incompatible with the GPL. Pic device
> libraries and header files are located at non-free/lib and non-free/include directories respectively. SDCC
> should be run with the --use-non-free command line option in order to include non-free header files and
> libraries.

> – sdbinutils utilities (sdar, sdranlib, sdnm, sdobjcopy):
> derived from GNU Binutils http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/; GPLv3 license

> 
> – sdcdb debugger:

> – gcc-test regression tests:
